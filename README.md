# keywordMT

Code archive for Leonard Nowaks Master’s thesis on keyword-aware machine translation.

This repository contains the experimental code used during the thesis work.  
It is **not intended to be a polished library or plug-and-play system**, but rather a reproducible reference for the conducted experiments.

## Overview

It focuses on integrating keyword and search-intent information into multilingual MT workflows and evaluating their impact on translation quality and keyword preservation.

This repository serves primarily as:
- an **academic code archive**
- a **reference implementation** for experiments discussed in the thesis

### Notes
- Configuration files are **not included** due to size constraints and are available upon request.
- Paths and parameters assume a research environment, not a production setup.
